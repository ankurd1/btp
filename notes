Functionality we want:
----------------------

-- show points(with bt and source line nums) where a kernel var was modified
		-- we need the map file and a var name and vmlinux
			-- vmlinux is probably a superset of the map file
        -- we also need path to gdb, path to qemu, qemu args, the qcow file

-- do the above for a user process' global vars
		-- we need the map file, a var name, the executable, (maybe) pid


User Interface:
---------------

-- Start the script
   a gdb type console appears
   you supply the req files using some command
   now you got two commands: track-kernel and track-user which take the reqd.
   args
   

Todo:
-----

-- show bts
-- make more robust
-- fix trivial stuff like more than 5 hits, watchu after watchk, streamline
their working
-- More testing
	-- Make a multithreaded user prog and test on it
	-- Find more kernel vars
	-- Run a popular multithreaded app

-- Investigate crash http://mclx.com/projects/crash/

Sem II:
------
-- Trace each instruction
-- disas, get mem loc, log change
-- Add to sqlite db - mem_addr, (eip, ecx, nbranches), old_data, new_data, bt
